# Dokokashira Door

"Enhances" vanilla doors.

For Modfest 1.17.

(based off a silly editing gimmick from *PiroPito First Playthrough of Minecraft*, which I'm hearing is a Doraemon reference)

## Todo

* Possibly throttle checksum stuff, or only send it once.
* Possibly a way for the server to go "something isn't right. disable prediction on your end"
* Test more with `clumsy`.
* Test circumstances where the client is not ready to perform prediction.
* Fix door sound effects.
* Add the actual "is the player close to the door" check.
